# Bot Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to use a bot for automation in the Faust.js frontend. The bot can automate tasks such as updating and adding content, importing and exporting the ACM Blueprint, and modifying language files.

## Setting Up the Bot

To set up the bot, follow these steps:

1. Install the bot by running the following command in your terminal: `npm install <bot-name>`.
2. Configure the bot by modifying the `bot-config.json` file in the root of your project. The configuration options will depend on the specific bot you are using.

## Issuing Commands to the Bot

You can issue commands to the bot through the terminal. Here are some examples:

- To import the ACM Blueprint, run: `bot-command import-acm-blueprint --url <URL_TO_ZIP>`.
- To export the ACM Blueprint, run: `bot-command export-acm-blueprint --options category_base,permalink_structure,nav_menu_options,theme_mods_twentytwentytwo --post-types nav_menu_item,post,page,testimonial,project`.
- To modify a language file, run: `bot-command modify-lang-file --file public/lang/en.ts --key "Update post successfully" --value "Post updated successfully"`.

## Monitoring the Bot's Actions

You can monitor the bot's actions by checking the logs in your terminal. Additionally, if the bot is set up to run as a GitHub Action, you can view the action's progress and results directly in GitHub.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the bot, try the following solutions:

- If the bot fails to install, make sure you have the latest version of Node.js and npm installed.
- If a command fails to execute, check the command syntax and make sure you are using the correct options and arguments.
- If the bot's actions are not as expected, check the bot's configuration in `bot-config.json` and make sure it is set up correctly.
